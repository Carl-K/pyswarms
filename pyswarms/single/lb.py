    """A local-best Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm.

    Similar to global-best PSO, it takes a set of candidate solutions,
    and finds the best solution using a position-velocity update method.
    However, it uses a ring topology, thus making the particles 
    attracted to its corresponding neighborhood.

    In this implementation, a neighbor is selected via two means: (1) by
    random, and (2) by closest distance. For #2, the Euclidean distance
    is computed. Empirically, this is much slower.
