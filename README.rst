PySwarms is a simple Python-based Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) library. It offers an array of
single-objective and multi-objective PSO algorithms, various objective functions to test your optimizer,
and an API for analyzing optimizer performance. 


* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://pyswarms.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------

1. Particle Swarm Optimizers
	
	a. Single-Objective PSO
		* Global-best 
		* Personal-best
	b. Multi-Objective PSO *(Coming soon)*

2. Objective Functions for single-objective and multi-objective problems
3. Performance analysis API *(Coming soon)*

Credits
---------

This project was inspired by the pyswarm_ module that performs PSO with constrained support. 
The package was created with Cookiecutter_ and the `audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`_ project template.
